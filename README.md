# Voronoi-tessellation
This code performs 2D and 3D Voronoi binning on an input set of coordinates and return the error-weighted average and median values measured within each Voronoi cell. This is an implementation of the code by Michele Cappellari (http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/). The code works with individual coordinates rather than with regularly-spaced pixels, allowing its use in resolved stellar populations.
